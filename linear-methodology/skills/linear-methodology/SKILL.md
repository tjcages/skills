description: >-
  Proven methodology for building and tracking features, projects, and issues
  in Linear. Use when the user wants to set up Linear tracking, sync or audit a
  board, run a Linear health check, finish install after skills add, or keep
  session discipline honest. Routes to linear-setup / linear-sync /
  linear-monitor / linear-finish-install as needed; linear-discipline is always-on.

# Linear Methodology

> Keep Linear useful by making it reflect the project, the repository, and the work actually happening.

## What it does

- Anchors tracking to the project's North Star and real roadmap.
- Sets up or repairs projects, milestones, issues, labels, and dependencies.
- Reconciles Linear with repository evidence instead of trusting stale tickets.
- Keeps active work current and closes the loop when work ships.

## How it works

1. Read [RESPONSE.md](./RESPONSE.md) for concise, action-first chat.
2. Read [AUTH.md](./AUTH.md), then verify Linear access before any call.
3. Route the request:
   - Set up, backfill, or start tracking → `linear-setup`
   - Sync, audit, or rescue a board → `linear-sync`
   - Check project health → `linear-monitor`
   - Finish installation → `linear-finish-install`
4. Apply `linear-discipline` throughout the session.
5. Use [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) when the routed skill needs deeper guidance.

Default ambiguous requests like “set up Linear tracking” to `linear-setup`.
